            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe are dayes that abound in the means of ſaving knowledge, but few partake of it: the moſt, like brutes, do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neglect it: others <hi>ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it,</hi> but not <hi>as for Gold;</hi> and many there be that preferre chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh toyes, and trifling know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

            <p n="1">1. It comforteth the ſoul to conſider, how many Wiſe and Learned men, are blinded by the god of this World, that, God <hi>hath hid</hi> Heavenly Myſteries <hi>from the wiſe and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180233:64"/>prudent of the World, and hath revealed them to</hi> poor <hi>babes:</hi> and to ſuch a poor ignorant creature as he was.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

Knowledge is uſeful to reſolve all doubts, and difficulties, which ariſe in our ſouls; this makes a man of a full and firm reſolution; a man is happy when he can ſay, This I know to be the mind of God, and in this will I live and die; this is the truth of God, and from this I will not be moved.
<note place="margin">Ignorantiae duae peſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae filiae, falſitas &amp; dubietas.</note> Ignorance is the mother of two filthy daughters; the firſt daughter of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is called <hi>dubiety,</hi> or doubtfulneſſe, which is a continual wavering in opinion; a knowing man hath a fixt ſpirit, and ſettled judgement, but an ignorant man is a <hi>double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded man,</hi> though he be never ſo reſolute and wilful in his opinions. The other daughter of Ignorance is <hi>falſity,</hi> or errour, which ſetleth a man upon an unſound baſis:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180233:65"/>he that is void of reaſon, will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by truth or reaſon: when there were divers opinions in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, who he ſhould be, ſome ſaid <hi>he was John Baptiſt, ſome Elias,</hi>

               <hi>others Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias, or one of the Prophets;</hi> this variety of opinions ſprang from ignorance: Some ſaid he was <hi>Elias, propter zelum &amp; amorem veritatis, for his zeal and love of the truth;</hi> for as <hi>Elias</hi> could not endure to have Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip mingled with idolatry; no more could Chriſt, as appears <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. by his puniſhing and caſting out of thoſe that bought and ſold in the Temple: others ſaid, he was <hi>Jeremias, propter patientiam in adverſis, being like a lambe before the ſhearer, not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mouth,</hi> however he was abuſed: and others ſaid, he was <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in reproving ſin, and this opinion for the moſt part went current; and the reaſon why it was more favoured and followed than the reſt, Divines obſerve to be, becauſe a great man was Author of it; as you may ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 14 2. for <hi>when Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jeſus, he ſaid unto his ſervant, this is John the Baptiſt, he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him:</hi> and then no matter, whether it be true or falſe, if <hi>Herod</hi> be the Author of it; for if <hi>Abimelech</hi> cut boughes from trees,

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180233:66"/>example. Here you may ſee the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ignorance, cauſing ſuch various and erroneous opinions concerning Chriſt; their ignorance of Chriſt, made way to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> opinion of the <hi>tranſmigration</hi> of ſouls into other mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which occaſioned all theſe errours; ſo groſſely ignorant were even the better ſort of people in Chriſts time, in a main funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion, as <hi>viz.</hi> Whether he were the Meſſiah or no: Now on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, knowledge reſolves all doubts: though others doubted who Chriſt was, yet <hi>Peter</hi> freely and clearly confeſſeth him, he doth not ſtay till a Council might be called, and the queſtion determined among the Jews; but knowing who Chriſt was, like the fore-man of a Jury, he brings in the verdict of himſelf and his followers, ſaying, (as <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us) to our Saviour,
<note place="margin">Math. 16.16.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the Living God.</hi> A man that hath clear eyes in his head, can diſcern the light if it be ſhewed him, but blindneſſe makes a man uncapable of ſeeing light of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him: knowledge reſolves a man, and ſetleth his judgement; without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a man cannot in divers caſes, diſcern truth from errour: as in the body of man, eyes are given to diſtinguiſh of colours, ears to diſtinguiſh of ſounds, pallats to diſtinguiſh of taſtes; ſo is knowledge very uſeful to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of Doctrines, that are tendered to

            <p n="6">6. Knowledge is <hi>uſeful</hi> to <hi>adorn the ſoul:</hi> knowledge is the ſoul's greateſt ornament: wiſdom (eſpecially heavenly wiſdom) <hi>makes a mans face to ſhine,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man:

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:180233:109"/>their Children as ſoon as they can ſpeak, to ſweare, and to ſwagger, to dice, dance, and drink, and think theſe good qualities, for them to be like their Fathers; ſurely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great mercy of God, they traine up their children to the devil; ſuch children will curſe their Parents at the laſt day, and wiſh that they rather had been the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a Toade, or a Dragon, than the Children of ſuch Parents; then will they cry out for judgement againſt them.</p>
            <p>Let Parents therefore be exhorted to teach their children the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to which no courſe that I can conceive is more fitting, then catechiſing, both by the Miniſter in the congregation publiquely,

               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21</note> the ſtipulation of a good conſcience, the baptized affirming, that thus and thus he believeth, and thus and thus he engageth.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180233:110"/>were inſtructed before they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
